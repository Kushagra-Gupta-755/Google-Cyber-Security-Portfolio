2. **Network Security Configuration**  
   - Firewall configuration and network traffic monitoring setup.

3. **Linux Server Security**  
   - Hardened a Linux server by configuring permissions, firewalls, and monitoring tools.

4. **SQL Security Analysis**  
   - Analyzed database vulnerabilities and implemented security measures using SQL.

5. **Python Automation for Security**  
   - Automated common security tasks, such as log analysis and threat detection, using Python scripts.

6. **Incident Response Playbook**  
   - Developed an incident response playbook to effectively respond to security breaches.
